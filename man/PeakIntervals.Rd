\title{Construct a PeakIntervals object from misha intervals}
\usage{
PeakIntervals(intervals, genome = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{intervals}{misha intervals (a data frame which has the following columns: 'chrom', 'start' and 'end')}

\item{genome}{genome assembly of the peaks. e.g. "hg38", "hg19", "mm9", "mm10".}
}
\value{
a PeakIntervals object
}
\description{
a PeakIntervals object is simply a misha intervals set which can have, optionally, a field called 'peak_name'
which holds the name of the peaks.

Note that if you have informative rownames you should make them
an explicit column due to the fact that the package might change
them occasionally (e.g. when creating h5ad files)
}
